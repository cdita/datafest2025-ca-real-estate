# Commercial Real Estate Microtrends for Tech Startups in California's Major Hubs

## Overview
This project was completed as part of **ASA DataFest 2025** at Duke University, where my team placed **Top 10 out of 58 teams**.  
We analyzed commercial rent, vacancy, unemployment, and lease-size data across **San Jose, Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco** to guide location decisions for technology startups.

## Objective
- Identify changes in **average lease sizes** before vs. after COVID-19.
- Compare leasing trends between different California cities.
- Provide insights that can help startups choose optimal office locations.

## My Role
- Led analysis on **average lease sizes** using side-by-side box plots to highlight pre- and post-COVID differences.
- Worked with teammates to select and refine our strongest visuals.
- Contributed to the narrative for the final presentation to judges.

## Tools & Skills Used
- **Python**: pandas, matplotlib
- **Data Visualization**: side-by-side box plots, comparative trend charts
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**
